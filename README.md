# SimpleAdmin
Codeigniter 4 Boilerplate Admin Dashboard, built on the backbone of SimpleAuth

### Folder Structure
In order to keep SimpleAdmin clean and modular all roles, users, modules and expantions will all have their own dedicated folder structure. I.e :

```
|--App
|  |--Controlers
|     |--Admin (our main route for all admin role controllers)
|        |-->AdminAuthController.php
|        |--Modules (Our modules folder for additional addon modules
```
